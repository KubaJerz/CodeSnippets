# Just some snippets I keep comming back to use in my jupyter notebook markdown cells

```
<style>
hr {
  border: none;
  border-top: 10px solid pink;
}
</style>

---

```

**which makes a nice thick line** and the pink does not mix with other colors in my IDE

Which makes the following nice thick line and the pink down not mix with other colors in my IDE, THIS WORKS IN VSCODE (not all markdown support, most don't github, etc.)

---


```
<small> TEXT </small>

<span style="font-size: smaller;">  TEXT </span>

````

Then both **used to make text smaller.** Can be used for links to data sources etc. 

Note the first one works both Colab and VSCode. The second one olny works in VSCode.

---

```
<span style="color:pink;"> SOME TEXT </span>

```

This code makes the text color in vscode md
