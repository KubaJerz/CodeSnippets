# Just some snippets I keep comming back to use in my jupyter notebook markdown cells

```
<style>
hr {
  border: none;
  border-top: 10px solid pink;
}
</style>

---

```

Which makes the following nice thick line and the pink down not mix with other colors in my IDE, THIS WORKS IN VSCODE (not all markdown support, most don't github, etc.)

<style>
hr {
  border: none;
  border-top: 10px solid pink;
}
</style>
