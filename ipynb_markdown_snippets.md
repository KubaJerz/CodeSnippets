# Just some snippets I keep comming back to use in my jupyter notebook markdown cells

```
<style>
hr {
  border: none;
  border-top: 10px solid pink;
}
</style>

---

```

which makes a nice thick line and the pink down not mix with other colors in my IDE


---


```
<small> TEXT </small>

<span style="font-size: smaller;">  TEXT </span>

````

Then both useed to make text smaller. Can be used for links to data sources etc. 

Note the fiirst one works both Colab and VSCode. The seccodn one olny works in VSCode.
